code-annotations
=============================

Extensible tools for parsing annotations in codebases

Overview
--------

This package provides configurable and extensible tools for parsing and
summarizing annotations in a wide range of codebases. Originally intended for
annotating code which stores personally identifiable information (PII), these
tools are optimized for that use case but can be generalized for other types of
annotations.

Additionally, a logically separate part of this repository will contain specific annotation configurations and supporting tools, such as Sphinx extensions for documenting specific annotation types. See the ``contrib`` folder.
